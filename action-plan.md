# Email Automation Agent - Action Plan

## System Audit Summary

After reviewing the codebase, I've identified several areas where functionality can be improved to ensure all components are properly interrelated and aligned with system requirements.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Disconnected HTML Files**: The platform consists of separate HTML files (`inbox.html`, `automation.html`, `flowconnect.html`, `promptlib.html`, `kbrules.html`, `index.html`) without a unified navigation or shared component system.

2. **Inconsistent Styling**: While the updated color scheme helps, there are still inconsistencies in component styling across pages.

3. **Limited Data Flow**: No clear mechanism for data to flow between the workflow builder, inbox, and rules engine.

4. **Missing Integration Points**: Lack of clear integration between inbox connector, pre-processor, LLM pipeline, and rule engine.

5. **Incomplete Mobile Responsiveness**: Some pages have limited mobile support.

## Action Plan

### 1. Create Shared Component Library (High Priority)
- Create `shared.css` and `shared.js` files to be included in all HTML files
- Extract common components (navbar, sidebar, cards, buttons) to ensure consistency
- Implement the updated color scheme across all pages

### 2. Implement Unified Navigation (High Priority)
- Add consistent sidebar navigation to all pages
- Ensure active state is properly highlighted based on current page
- Add breadcrumbs for improved navigation context

### 3. Improve Data Flow Between Modules (High Priority)
- Create mock API endpoints in JavaScript to simulate data flow
- Add localStorage-based state management for demo purposes
- Implement data passing between workflow builder and rules engine

### 4. Enhance Integration Points (Medium Priority)
- Add configuration screens for inbox connectors (Gmail, Outlook, IMAP)
- Create interface for LLM pipeline configuration
- Implement rule testing that shows how emails flow through the system

### 5. Improve Mobile Responsiveness (Medium Priority)
- Review and fix responsive issues in all pages
- Implement collapsible sidebar for mobile views
- Ensure all tables have proper horizontal scrolling on small screens

### 6. Add System Settings Page (Medium Priority)
- Create comprehensive settings page for system configuration
- Include integration settings, user management, and system preferences
- Add API key management for LLM services

### 7. Create Onboarding Flow (Low Priority)
- Design step-by-step onboarding process for new users
- Include mailbox connection, initial rule setup, and workflow creation
- Add tooltips and contextual help throughout the application

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Shared component library and unified navigation
2. **Week 2**: Data flow improvements and integration points
3. **Week 3**: Mobile responsiveness and settings page
4. **Week 4**: Onboarding flow and final testing

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Create `shared.css` and extract common styles
2. Implement unified sidebar navigation across all pages
3. Create mock API for data flow between components
4. Update inbox page to show integration with workflow and rules
